== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the frequency of article creation? =

Yes, you can set the number of posts per day in the plugin settings. The plugin will distribute the article creation evenly throughout the day.

= What languages are supported? =

= How does the plugin choose topics for articles? =

= Can I choose whether the generated articles are published immediately or saved as drafts? =

Yes, in the plugin settings, you can choose whether to publish articles immediately or save them as drafts for review before publishing.
